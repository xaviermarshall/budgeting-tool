# Simple Python Budgeting Tool

This is just a simple tool to budget your income based on 3 factors:

1. "Essentials" or "Needs"

2. "Wants"

3. "Savings" and/or "Debt Repayment"

It works by taking the user's income, and then the percentage of their income they'd like to put toward each category. After that, it does some simple calculations to determine how 
much of the user's income should be dedicated to each category.

The categories are initialized based on the "50/30/20" rule of savings, but some people may want to put more into savings, or they don't spend that much on housing/groceries/fuel, 
so this tool gives the option to pick and choose how much they want where.

This was a fun little project to learn some new skills with.
